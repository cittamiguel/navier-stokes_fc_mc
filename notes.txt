To fit data arrays in atom's memory system hierarchies use the following ecuation

N<sqrt( memSize / (2**5)*6)   ~aproximation

6 bc there are 6 arrays intizialized, 2**5 bc sizeof(float)


memory footprint of data estimated to be ~ N**2 * 2**5 * 6


---> to fit in L1d => N < 256, 
               L2 => 256 < N < 1024,
               L3 => 1024 < N < 3344

when using /usr/bin/time we get a max resident memory footprint > L1 size even using N's as low as 8, but this is also accounting for the
memory the code is using and so on, so we had to make an aproximation.
